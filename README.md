## User Story  
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly  

## Acceptance Criteria  
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## What I learned
* keeping code clean throughout the coding process enables others to help more effectively.  
* Learning how to read API documentation and implement it correctly
* I am still struggling with local storage and using it for element generation, but I feel like I am making progress.

## Known Bugs
* There is currently a problem on certain browsers that is preventing the API response. I am working on fixing it and plan to ask My teacher for his input.
